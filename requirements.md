# Software Requirements


## Vision
To create a fun, simple, and user-specific application that makes book recommendations based on the users genre preference. The user will also be provided with the ability to read the book in the application.


## Scope (In/Out)
### IN
- The web app will make a book recommendation based on user preferences
- The web app will allow the user to log in to store books in and view their library
- The user will be able to read the book in the web app
- The webb app will have an About Us page that will contain pictures of all contributors and background information.
- The user will be able to log in and change their preferences.
- The web app will allow the user to log in and continue reading where they left off previuosly.

## OUT 
- This web app will not let you search for a specific book to read
- This will not be a mobile app

## MVP
- The user will be brought to a preference page where they make a genre selection They are presented with the ability to create a user profile. Once logged in they will brough to the library with a book recommendation. They can then open the book to read it. There will also be an about me page.

## Stretch
- Paralax effect on images in about me page
- Page turn effect when changing pages
- Adding other category preferences such as movies, food, etc.
- Users can send recommendations to other users

## Functional Requirements
- An admin can create
- A user can update their profile preferences
- A user can view all of their books in the library
- A can view the about us page

## Data Flow
1. The main page will display images/preferences and user login
2. The user profile will be stored in a database
3. Once a preference is selected they will be brough to the library page where a book recommendation is shown.
4. When the user clicks on the book it will open to be read
5. When navigating away from this page the page is saved in the database
6. When the about us link is pressed the user is brough to the about us page
7. The user can then go back to the home page to change their preferences and or get a new recommendation for a book
8.  The footer link can be clicked which is a link to the github page 

## Non-Functional Requirements
We will design this app to be scalable in the event that we are able to add more categories for recommendation such as movies and food. This will provide the user with a variety of recommendations. We will also design the app to be user friendly by allowing the user to modify their account and read books without navigating to 3rd party web apps.
